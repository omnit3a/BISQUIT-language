# Hypersquit
A repository for the Hypersquit programming langauge
Current Version: BISQUIT V0.1

#How to write a program
Each program consists of two strings, the Commands and the Arguments. Each command in the Commands String must have a corresponding argument in the Arguments string. If there is no argument necessary for a givem command (according to the "instruction set.txt" file), then set the corresponding argument to be 0.

The Commands string is on line 260 of "Main.java"

The Arguments string is on line 261 of "Main.java"

# Memory
The memory of this version of Hypersquit has 255 addresses builtin, but it can be expanded by simply adding to the "compMemory" int array.

# Benefits of using Hypersquit
Currently, Hypersquit only has two purposes.
The first is to make a langauge that can very easily have modifications made of it, the second is for it to be a fun project for me to make.

# TODO (In order of urgency)
-Add the ability to read programs from files instead of from the source code of the langauge

-Improve the branching commands

-Make a compiler for the language, so that it can be run independent of the java source file
