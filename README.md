# Hypersquit
A repository for the Hypersquit programming langauge

Current Version: Hypersquit v0.21

# How to write a program
To write a program, follow the specified syntax in the "instruction set.txt" file. All lines of code must end with a colon.

To run a program, save the code as a ".hysq" file and enter the path to the saved file in the console of "Main.java" when running

# Memory
The memory of this version of Hypersquit has 255 addresses builtin, but it can be expanded by simply adding to the "compMemory" int array.

# Benefits of using Hypersquit
Currently, Hypersquit only has two purposes.
The first is to make a langauge that can very easily have modifications made of it, the second is for it to be a fun project for me to make.

# TODO (In order of urgency)
-Add the ability to add comments to code (In progress)

-Add input capability to the langauge (In progress)

-Make a compiler for the language, so that it can be run independent of the java source file

-Improve the branching commands
